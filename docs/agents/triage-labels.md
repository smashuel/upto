# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. With a local-markdown
issue tracker, the "label" is a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file in
`.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.

| Canonical role    | Status string in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | `needs-triage`               | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`      | `needs-info`                 | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent`            | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human`            | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`         | `wontfix`                    | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the
corresponding string on the issue file's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
